# Orc_Must_Fry
Student learning UE4 Project

Made using a compiled version of Unreal Engine 4.21.
To compile either switch version, or have a UE 4.21 compiled version ready on your computer.
You can also just have a 4.21 version installed, you won't be able to break inside the engine code.

Repository .gitignore configurated to ingore all useless UE4 files so that the repo doesn't weight several Go for nothing.
