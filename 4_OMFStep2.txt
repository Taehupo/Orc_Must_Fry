Projectiles/traps

We start to implement projectiles and traps for the game, we will set the base class we need for the projectiles and the traps.
Use the projectileComponent from Unreal and the ActorSequenceComponent for animation (this one is optional).
This starts on 10/11 and finish on 22-23/11 you have two weeks including one Unreal class to complete this, then we will correct.

Projectiles:

ProjectileComponent : Component existing in Unreal, use it to implement the following projectiles

//Done
Arrow : normal projectile
//Done
Bullet : same just different body
//Done
Grenade : bouncing and exploding after time
//Done
Mine : sticking and exploding on command
//Done
Explosive : exploding on hit aoe
//Control by player ??? Explode on hit + setup input for manual boomage
Mamouchka : rocket controlled by the player when fired, exploding on hit or on command

Traps:

//Done
SpikeTrap : inflict damage when an ennemy walks on it
//Done
TarTrap : slow an ennemy walking on it
//Damage zone that is activated on CD
SwingMace : inflict damage on CD (animation like a melee weapon)
//Done
ArrowWall : fire multiple arrows when an ennemy walks in front of it (system to generates the number of projectiles asked by the variable designer)
//Done
BoomBarrel : explode on damaged
//Fire homing projectile
Ballista : shoot arrow to a target (projectile follow target)
//ArrowTrap, just different projectile
Bomber : shoot explosive to a position (system to generates the number of projectiles asked by the variable designer)
//Big Sphere collider, everything insede takes dmg on cd
IceTower : slow all ennemies in range on CD
//Big Sphere collider, everything insede takes dmg on cd
FireTower : burn all ennemies in range on CD
//Big Sphere collider, everything insede takes dmg on cd, shoot it to reload it
BladeTornado : damage all ennemies in range when reloaded
//Big Sphere collider, everything insede takes dmg & stops on cd, shoot it to reload it
Blizzard : stop and damage all ennemies in range when reloaded

ActorSequenceComponent (optional) : Component existing in a plugin, you can use it to implement animation for melee weapons and traps if you want
it's a WIP feature so it's buggy, use it only in Blueprint
